Image Classification for Sustainable Fashion

This project builds an AI-powered image classifier to assess sustainability indicators of clothing items from product images, enabling more responsible and transparent consumer decision-making.

1. Problem Statement
India’s textile and apparel sector significantly contributes to the economy (2.3% GDP, 13% industrial output, 12% exports), but it also generates 7.8 million tonnes of waste annually—8.5% of global textile waste. Only 34% is reused and 25% recycled, intensifying environmental pressures.
Consumer demand for sustainability is rapidly increasing: 89% of Indians report purchasing eco-friendly fashion, 60% actively prefer sustainable products, and 80% express strong environmental concern. Yet, sustainability data for fashion products remains limited and inconsistent across digital platforms.

2. Proposed Solution
Image classification system to extract sustainability-related attributes directly from clothing images:

• Material Type → Natural / Synthetic / Recycled
• Brand Category → Ethical / Fast Fashion

Expected Outcomes:
• Transparent sustainability insights during purchase
• Boost ethical brand visibility
• Reduced textile waste and improved product lifecycle choices

3. Sustainability Impact
This solution supports UN SDGs:
• SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
• SDG 13: Climate Action

4. Possible Data Sources
• TextileNet Dataset (Kaggle)
• Custom Built Brand Dataset

5. Possible Technologies to be used
Training Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
Preprocessing: OpenCV, NumPy
Evaluation & Visualization: Matplotlib
Version Control: Git + GitHub
